# The test folder
***
This is where the whole project's tests are placed.

## What can one do here?
***
"Anyone" can add their own tests by adding a module following the template test file (test_something.py). The matching fields should be the name (test_*.py) and the content layout (subclassing unittest.TestCase, etc).

"Anyone" can run the existing tests by running: 

`python -m unittest discover`
***

More to come...
